# [Title]

## Abstract

[One paragraph. State the core problem, the proposed method, and key results.]

## Introduction

[Background and motivation for the research. What gap does this work address? What is the research question? Academic tone. No implementation details.]

## Method

[Describe the mathematical principles and algorithmic framework. Include concrete formulas. No class names, function calls, or file paths. The level of detail should match an academic paper — explain the core ideas and key equations that define the approach.]

## Result

[Present experimental results. Include embedded images and tables.

Images must be embedded inline, not merely linked:
![Description of figure](path/to/image.png)

Tables use standard Markdown:

| Metric | Baseline | Proposed |
|--------|----------|----------|
| ...    | ...      | ...      |

Include analysis and interpretation of the results.]
